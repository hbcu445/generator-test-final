# AI Help Service TODO

## Test Page Complete Redesign (from sketch)
- [x] Header row: Generator Source logo | Location | Date | Person icon + name | Clock + timer | Pause button
- [x] Progress display: "QUESTION 1 of 100 | COMPLETE: 1%"
- [x] Question text: Large, clear, centered
- [x] Answer options: Radio button style (A, B, C, D) with circles
- [x] Navigation: Yellow BACK arrow (left) | Yellow NEXT arrow (right)
- [x] DaVinci AI logo in bottom right corner

## Test Page Layout Fixes (from user screenshot feedback)
- [ ] Fix header: all info (location, date, name, timer, pause) should be in ONE horizontal row (currently stacked)
- [ ] Fix progress display formatting: showing "1001%" instead of "1%"
- [ ] Remove "BASIC ELECTRICITY" category text from test page
- [ ] Improve navigation arrow styling with proper yellow triangular shapes
